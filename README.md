I have completed my media Query Assingment using the html and css. lets see what i have done :-
1) In this project first i have made the same UI that was given then i apply the media Query property .
2) In the given UI first i made the div name that div as container in which all or div lie.
3) then we see that there is nav bar type div is given so i give nav as class main-1 and apply the css that her background color is white.
4) then below  the nav we see there is another div given class as main-2  where our image , head section and para was there . so this main-1 div contain the image which have tha class as main-3.
5) We give some property to this main-2 div that height, color , margin, padding , position.
6) we also give some property to image as height, width, margin-top, position as absolute.
7) we also give our header h1 section as text-align center, font-weight.
8) we also give paragraph as property that margin, tet=xt-align, opacity, margin.
9) below the p tag we see that we have button so give button tag as class main and give some property as background-color as black anc color as white and some height , width.
10) then we move to our media query section after completing the UI.
11) In the media Query we see that how our  UI is looking in the laptop screen, mobile screen, tablet screen, desktop screen so for that we apply the min-weidth and some max-weidth and check .
12) we usually apply media query as @media screen and (min-weidth:500px){}... this is the syntax . In our project basically i apply my media query on the nav bar i have given that on max-width:500px our nav backgoround-color is become #cyan.
13) and also apply on image also given some height , width.
